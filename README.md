# Saathwale
1.1	Project Overview:

Carpooling may be one of the best solutions when there is no other mean of transportation to a specific location but naturally it is not the only one. Some people start to prefer using new carpooling services over the traditional services represented by taxi services. SaathWale aims to promote carpooling by targeting elders making it easier for them to adhere and use this system.

1.2	Hardware Specification:

•	Smart phone (Android)
•	Minimum ram required 2 GB


1.3	Software Specification:

	IDE: Android Studio.

	Backend: Flutter

	Database: MySQL

	Mobile with Android version above 6.0 with Location tracking

1.4	Proposed Architecture:

•	Login: Since all the operations that can be done using the application requires the rider, passenger to be logged in, they can use the login forms by entering their required credentials (User name and password).
•	Rider: The rider is any person that owns a car and wants to go from one place to another and publishes his trip on the application in order to find passengers to share the ride with.
•	Passenger: Passenger is any person that doesn’t own a car and wants to join a rider in a ride. The passenger posted and agrees to all the conditions specified (price and general behavior).
•	Ride Scheduling: The rider can schedule the rides to be displayed when passengers search for ride. The application will prompt the information of the regular ride which consists of destination, origin, meeting, departure time/date, estimated arrival time and traveling preferences.
 
•	Find Ride: When a passenger needs to find a rider for a destination, he can use a search form which asks for destination, origin, departure date/time. He can also specify the travelling preferences.
